# News-API-Website
This web application built using Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS was created with the purpose of displaying the top 20 news stories by default on the home page using Python's 'requests' library and when a user searches something, I used JavaScript's fetch method to show a maximum of 500 different news articles on a particular subject.
